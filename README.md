- Clover PHP (for processing PHPUnit code coverage xml output)
- DRY (for processing phpcpd logfiles in PMD-CPD format)

To properly use the plugins QA tools are installed aswell [http://pear.phpqatools.org/](http://pear.phpqatools.org/)

## Requirements ##

- Vagrant (tested with 1.2.7)

## Installation ##

- git clone https://github.com/marcojanssen/vagrant-puppet-jenkins.git
- git submodule init
- git submodule update
- vagrant up

Change the IP adres to whatever you want in the Vagrantfile, and add that IP adres to your host file, for example:

> 192.168.2.200 ci

Jenkins can be accessed from port 8080, http://ci:8080

## Troubleshooting

There are some issues with Ubuntu Raring ringtail and Vagrant:

The steps you should follow are:

Check if you have Vagrant 1.2.7
``` bash
vagrant --version
```

If Vagrant hangs on this step (ctrl+c) for aborting and run vagrant up again:
``` bash
[default] Waiting for VM to boot. This can take a few minutes.
```

If you see puppet running & finishing succesfully, you are good to go and you should be able to access jenkins on 192:168:2:200:8080
``` bash
[default] Running provisioner: puppet...
